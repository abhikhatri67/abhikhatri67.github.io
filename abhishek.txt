<!-- About -->

Hey There! I am Abhishek Khatri.

I'm a seasoned Principal Software Engineer specializing in FrontEnd development with over 6.5 years of experience. I thrive on spearheading impactful projects. At GoGroup, I led the development of a green energy portal, showcasing my proficiency in ReactJS and collaboration skills.

My passion for innovation shines in projects like "heyport," a Port call coordination tool, where I streamlined communication in the maritime industry using ReactJS and AWS services. As a Front-End Team Lead at Smart Joules, I initiated JouleTrack (BMS), a progressive web app with Angular.

Proficient in ReactJS, Ruby on Rails, Angular, NodeJS, Serverless, AWS, and GraphQL, I hold a bachelor's in Technology (Computer Science) from DIT University.
